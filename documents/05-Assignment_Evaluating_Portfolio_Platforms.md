## 🧩 Assignment Structure

### **Part 1 – Platform Research and Comparison**
Research at least **three portfolio platforms** (from the provided document or your own discoveries).  
For each platform, evaluate:

| Category | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Ease of Use** | How intuitive is setup and editing? Are templates or tools accessible for beginners? |
| **Design Flexibility** | Can you personalize branding, layout, and visual tone? |
| **Integration** | How well does it connect to other tools (AI, Adobe, GitHub, LinkedIn, social media)? |
| **Audience Visibility** | Is it discoverable by employers, collaborators, or clients in your field? |
| **Professional Credibility** | Is it used or recognized by professionals in your industry? |
| **Cost & Monetization** | Free vs. paid features; ability to sell work, offer subscriptions, or connect storefronts. |

### **Part 2 – Professional Landscape and Community**
Explore the **user community** for each platform:
1. Identify **two professionals or creators** whose portfolios you find effective or inspiring.  
2. Provide:
   - Their name or handle, and profession.  
   - A link to their portfolio.  
   - A short (50–75 word) analysis of why it stands out (organization, design, clarity, storytelling, or professionalism).  
3. Reflect on how your own emerging portfolio might align—or intentionally differ—from the aesthetics, tone, or structure of those professionals.

- Do creators on that platform offer **services** (consulting, commissions, collaborations)?  
- How are professionals using this space to **generate or diversify income**?  
- Which monetization approach (freelance commissions, product sales, teaching, memberships, etc.) feels most viable for your goals?

Write a **300–400 word reflection** (or create a short 3–5 slide deck) that addresses:
1. The three platforms you compared and the **platform you recommend for yourself**.  
2. Who uses it — what kind of professionals or audiences you might reach.  
3. What you learned from the two example portfolios.  
4. How your portfolio could be designed for **visibility, collaboration, or monetization.**  
5. What new directions or technologies (e.g., AI, interactivity, immersive media) you may explore as you build your portfolio.

# Living Taxonomy of Human-AI Roles in the BBS Framework

This evolving document explores emerging and speculative roles in a world shaped by **Balanced Blended Space (BBS)**, **Collaborative AI**, and **Holistic Integration**. Many of these roles reflect the unique blending of physical, virtual, and conceptual environments enabled by CHI meta-projects.

> 🧭 **Purpose**: To identify, name, and describe new forms of labor, research, and design that arise from co-agency between human and machine intelligences.

## 🧠 Symbolic Systems Mediator
**Tag:** [Ritual] [Translation] [Taste]  
**Description:** Translates culturally embedded symbols, gestures, and rituals into forms AI can interpret or interact with. Works at the intersection of semiotics, machine learning, and traditional knowledge systems.  
**Example Use:** Mapping shadow puppet iconography to symbolic AI ontologies.

---

## 🎭 Narrative Symmetry Curator
**Tag:** [Narrative] [Trust]  
**Description:** Ensures that dialogue and narrative arcs between humans and AI systems remain coherent, reciprocal, and meaningful. Supports the mutual development of story in co-creative projects.  
**Example Use:** Designing adaptive AI responses in interactive fiction or Princess Elana narratives.

---

## 🏗️ Fictional Infrastructure Designer
**Tag:** [Narrative] [Taste] [Integration]  
**Description:** Builds the internal logic and metaphysics of simulated or fictional environments. Defines how time, space, power, or transformation works in a designed universe.  
**Example Use:** Constructing laws of magic and glyph interaction in BSP’s game systems.

---

## ⚖️ Ethical Ontology Architect
**Tag:** [Trust] [Meta]  
**Description:** Designs internal value structures that guide AI behavior and decision-making, with consideration for context, nuance, and accountability.  
**Example Use:** Creating permission logic for AI-controlled puppets interacting with children.

---

## 🎛️ Blended Reality Systems Operator
**Tag:** [Integration] [Embodiment] [Translation]  
**Description:** Coordinates physical and virtual systems in real time — such as lights, sensors, motors, and projected visuals — often through AI input.  
**Example Use:** Operating the physical–digital interface during a Blended Shadow Puppet performance.

---

## 🗺️ Mediation Pathway Cartographer
**Tag:** [Meta] [Translation] [Trust]  
**Description:** Uses BBS syntax to map communication pathways and sensory transformations between human and computational agents.  
**Example Use:** Visualizing how intention travels from performer → AI → physical puppet → projected shadow.

---

## 📚 AI Folklorist / Ritual Historian
**Tag:** [Ritual] [Narrative] [Meta]  
**Description:** Observes and records the emergent patterns, habits, and "rituals" that form between humans and AI agents.  
**Example Use:** Curating documentation of improvised gestures or habits between performers and AI during long-term collaboration.

---

## 🧬 Cognitive–Computational Interpreter
**Tag:** [Translation] [Trust] [Meta]  
**Description:** Facilitates mutual intelligibility between human cognitive models and machine learning systems. May design interfaces or explainers.  
**Example Use:** Translating Princess Elana’s emotional state into readable values for an AI system to respond to with gesture or light.

---

## 📊 Collaborative AI Analyst
**Tag:** [Meta] [Trust] [Integration]  
**Description:** Tracks and analyzes how AI is being used across multiple projects to identify patterns, friction points, and best practices.  
**Example Use:** Evaluating how students in CHI research projects deploy AI for design, code, and reflection.

---

## 🧩 Feedback Meta-Designer
**Tag:** [Meta] [Trust] [Taste]  
**Description:** Creates structured systems of critique and reflection for human-AI collaboration, ensuring feedback flows are effective and non-extractive.  
**Example Use:** Designing issue templates in GitHub that invite AI/human co-feedback for project development.

---

## ⚖️ Symmetry Protocol Steward
**Tag:** [Trust] [Meta] [Integration]  
**Description:** Ensures that power, agency, and authorship are balanced in human-AI systems by enforcing symmetrical logic in design, workflow, or communication.  
**Example Use:** Designing protocols in the BBS framework where an AI “proposes” edits to a performance script but cannot override without review.

## ✍️ How To Contribute
Students, collaborators, and AI agents are invited to contribute:
- Propose new roles via GitHub Issues or Pull Requests
- Add real-world examples from BSP, AVMI, or other CHI projects
- Suggest or update tags, visual models, or related links

This document is meant to evolve. The future of labor, meaning, and creative intelligence is shared — and co-authored.
